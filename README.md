**Happy Halloween!**

Being that Horror has always been my favorite genre, I will recommend some Horror to check out!  Barbarian AND Smile were both fun theatrical watches!  Hellraiser Reboot on Hulu is fun if you are a Clive Barker fan (Midnight Meat Train, Candyman 1 & 2, Lord of Illusions, Nightbreed, Book of Blood & Books of Blood [2 different adaptations!], Rawhead Rex, list goes on:)  

My primary gripe with Hellraiser is that it forces out 5.1 surround sound, which screws things up for those who do not have a good sound system.  It will likely sound like garbage on normal TV speakers!  This means you may have to possibly crank up the volume to even hear it, or use leveling audio settings on your TV, if applicable, to get a decent experience!  I miss the days where one could "choose" audio streams, which Blu-Ray Disks generally allow you to do!  A majority of other movies/tv shows that do this were fine for me.  Hellraiser was just an oddball that came out with low volume for me on about every device I tested it on, including my PC!  Streaming Services really need to make it possible to "choose" audio streams, if it could be coded into the apps/websites reasonably!!!  

X & Pearl were good "retro-styled" movies.  For those who like found footage films ala Blair Witch Project, Chronicles, Afflicted...Deadstream on Shudder is an effective one:)  Midnight Club is like Breakfast Club crossed with Are You Afraid of the Dark!  Dahmer series, also on Netflix is "creepy" fodder, with great performances.  My personal favorite recent Crime Series would be Black Bird on Apple TV!  I feel both Dahmer and Black Bird may be nominated for awards of some kind, by Emmy's time!  Stingray from Cobra Kai plays one of the protaganists in Black Bird, as well!  I sense him going places in the acting world, future wise:)  Rob Zombie's Munsters Love Letter will apply to fans of the original 60's era Addam's Family/Munsters macabre style, hehe.  It is more of a kid's film than anything he has ever done before.  Bright and bold, uniquely interesting for those that can get invested!

**Why so long for THIS Release?!**

Well, many factors play into each new concurrent Release, including motivation, real life, actual worthwhile additions, and of course, time to implement them all:)  And, do not forget "testing, testing, testing!" Many things have happened this year for me and others involved in our projects.  In my own personal life, two of my jobs were impacted by the "Covid Lockdowns".  One of them consolidated into another location.  The other job outright shut down.  BUT, luckily, I was immediately offered employment at 2.5 times my previous rate, but much further away, drive wise!  I have since adjusted to that grueling drive, hehe:)  The consolidated job worked out, too.  I ended up being kept on as IT Tech, and got a pay raise, there, as well.  So, those jobs, along with my IT Tech self employment, have been able to help me make ends meet, as well as save some pocket change for the future!

My rescued cat of 13 years, developed a cancerous growth that couldn't be removed.  And, unfortunately, she passed earlier in the year.  After the initial grief had settled in, I suggested we give another "fur baby" a loving home.  And, I one day found the perfect one for us when checking out the local humane society listings.  And, upon meeting the lil kitten, the next day, I knew she would be a perfect fit.  Since I adopted her, she has quickly adjusted to her new home, as did we her.  She will forever be our "chaos kitten" now!  She may be sleeping one moment, then running across my Rock Band and Electronic Drums and TV stand, the next, parkour, David Belle, straight out of District B13, style!...

Initially, since she was so tiny, we kept her in the bathroom at night.  But, slowly, but surely, I gave her more and more freedom.  There was "one" day, where I had to work, and my wife did, as well.  And, I didn't want the new kitten to be couped up all day.  We have our other 11 year old cat, who also adjusted to her, and her him!  I messaged my wife to just let the "chaos kitten" be free and do what she wants.  And, low and behold, she was absolutely fine:)  

We still stuck to letting her sleep in the bathroom.  She would cry a little, then finally settle down.  One day, she decided to remodel the bathroom when she got bored.  That was the day I decided, no more bathroom for her.  And, she has since had 110 percent total freedom and run of the house.  If she isn't running around like a mini tornado, she is usually cuddling on my lap, or sleeping next to me in bed!  She has chosen to be quite inseparable from myself and my wife, and loves human contact.  I have also caught her snuggling with our other cat, haha!  For those of you who don't even like cats, if you think about it, cats are just dogs with attitude, anyways:)

In any case, the Amiga 500 Mini also came along.  And, MadFranko strongly requested I get involved in that Scene.  And, I decided to do just that.  It has worked out quite nicely.  Between the two of us, we have gotten some solid state of the art stuff up and running ON the system:)  That will be part of this Release, as well! 

**Let's start out with two deceptively simple questions.."Does the movie make the song...Or, does the song make the movie?**

- Against All Odds = Phil Collins - Against All Odds
- Over the Top = Kenny Loggins - Meet Me Halfway
- St. Elmo's Fire = John Parr - Man in Motion  
- Top Gun = Kenny Loggins - Highway to the Danger Zone

What would you say YOUR personal favorite example/s would be?  This could apply to TV Shows, as well...of course!  For me, it is easily the untouchable Guns N' Roses - You Could Be Mine, from Terminator 2!  As a kid, I was also a big fan of the movie Time Bandits, by Terry Gilliam, of Monty Python fame!  I loved the end credits song Dream Away by George Harrison!  And, I also loved the main song in Electric Dreams, called Together in Electric Dreams, by Philip Oakley of Human League!  

Better Off Dead was a great John Cusack movie, with a song I was always fond of, With One Look (The Wildest Dream), by Rupert Hine.  The first time I watched Young Einstein, with Yahoo Serious..I was blown away by the band Icehouse, who did the song Great Southern Land.  They also did another more well known hit called Electric Blue, which...by the way, is a close tie to my all time favorite song...Take on Me by AHA!  There are so many more I could bring up.  But, I would absolutely love to see what gems any of you all, who are now reading my Release Notes, can muster up!  And, please, don't say the "Baby Dancing song from Ally McBeal and Guardians of the Galaxy!"

**In any case, here we are!  Top Gun: Maverick has finally come out, and it was "most excellent"!:)**

One thing I have always found frustrating is, delay after delay!  Duke Nukem, etc!  But, damn, if Top Gun: Maverick didn't get delayed so much that the planes in the movie are all rusted over by now!  What movie, TV show, Game, etc., have you looked so forward to...to have your hopes shattered by a cancellation, and/or delay!  For me, I was always a Jaws fan!  I got very irritated to keep seeing Jaws Unleashed for Xbox, PC, PS2, get delayed again and again!  It did finally come out!  But, it had absolutely horrendous reviews.  And, as a whole, was considered a complete flop!  But, as a fan, I was able to appreciate it for what it was...Grand Theft Shark Auto!  The ideas and concept were later honored in another game, Maneater!  Maneater was and still is such a fun game!  By the way, the original developers of Jaws Unleashed, Appaloosa, also made Contra: Legacy of War and Ecco: Defender of the Future, ALL 3 Ecco Games on Genesis AKA MegaDrive, Kolibri (amazing 32X game!) and Three Dirty Dwarves (flawless Sega Saturn Brawler!)

Top Gun: Maverick has finally come out, after several delays!  Whether or not you are a Tom Cruise fan or not, there is no denying that he has been part of many great movies over the years, including Minority Report, American Made, Mission Impossibles, Edge of Tomorrow, Collateral, Last Samurai, The Color of Money, Rain Man!  What is your favorite movie that he is in, be it you like his acting or not?  For me, I would say Edge of Tomorrow!  I love my time travel movies!

**What other movies, TV Shows, Music, etc?**

I have adjusted to my new job quite nicely.  So many amazing coworkers there.  I have been managing my time as well as I can, so that I can still have a little free time each week to catch up on the latest theatrical, streaming, etc., releases!  I had fun with Nicolas Cage's The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.  Like my mention above of "liking or disliking" Tom Cruise...some simply aren't fans of The Cage.  But, I have always enjoyed him in about any and every movie I have seen him in.  Obviously, Con-Air, The Rock, Face-Off, would be 3 of my favorites!  Yours?

I got to see The Northman, which ironically, starred Alexander Skarsgard...who also played a character named Eric Northman in True Blood...!  The movie was based on Hamlet, which was a Shakespeare Story based on an old Vikings Tale!  Full Circle, and quite a fun movie, overall!  Kind of reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian, with the stylistic approach of Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now!

Speaking of Coppola, did you know that Nicolas Cage's real name is Nicolas Coppola, and he is directly related to Francis...But, he changed his name, so as to be able to pave his own way!  Also, speaking of Coppola, the biopic The Offer is an interesting watch (whether it is fudged or half-truth or whatever have you!)  Biopics, Movies based on True Events or Stories, tend to always get cumulative complaints about how unreliable their overall depictions were.  But, hey, it is meant to be entertainment!  If they tried to make it as fact based as possible, it might be closer to the fun of watching paint dry!  If they wanna have a flying unicorn in a Lolita Long Island Story, so be it!  I also enjoyed watching Winning Time: Rise of the Lakers!  Fun show, especially if you are at all a basketball fan!  Jerry West's depiction drew complaints from him, saying he was nothing like that in real life!  But, no matter the case, his character was a riot to watch!!!

Doctor Strange Sequel was a fun film, especially for anyone who is a Sam Raimi fan of the "Evil Dead" phase:)  If you haven't seen WandaVision, the movie will not have as much impact.  That is the most I can say.  But, it is far less the typical superhero movie you would expect from Marvel, and more like a love letter to Evil Dead, by the original creator, with a Marvel Reskin!

Top Gun: Maverick...it fits into the category of movies that are arguably better than the originals.  These include Terminator 2, Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (note, Khan in the Star Trek Reboot was played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who also played Doctor Strange:), Godfather: Part 2 (which, by the way, the Paramount+ Series The Offer is a biopic about the creation of!  Fun series, so far.  But, do not take it to be 100 percent accurate:).  What would you say YOUR personal favorite sequel that exceeds the original is!?

Bullet Train was fun, sparked of movies, such as John Wick AND Smokin' Aces, with some homages to Tarantino, and so on!  I liked Orphan: First Kill.  Usually, you wouldn't expect much out of a seemingly generic horror movie prequel/sequel.  But, this was was well done, especially for a horror fan to enjoy!  

Finished up Stranger Things.  It was quite derivative of many, many other things I have seen...But, also enjoyable!  I always had this thought that Eleven felt like she was straight out of the Anime, Elfen Lied!  And, doing a quick search, I find that it was almost intentional as inspiration for her character!  If you haven't seen Elfen Lied, be sure to check it out!  It will most certainly remind you a bit of Eleven:)  And, nice to see Metallica AND Kate Bush getting a surge in popularity, due to their being within the OST to the show!  Speaking of OSTs!!!  Just you wait:)

Lord of the Ring Series, House of the Dragon, Serpent Queen, all fun representations to check out, too!  I will stop now, before I over-recommend.  Check back in future Releases, as well as in my YouTube Videos, for more discussions about movies, tv shows, music, etc, to get into!

Scott Adkins is a great martial artist I have been following for nearly 20 years now, in many many movies.  His latest movie, Accident Man Holiday is just one hell of a fun ride worth watching!  I can go on and on about other shows and movies I would recommend, etc.  But, I will save some of these for my next videos!

**Now, for the Release!**

Hope you all have been enjoying the Last Release!  I did what I could to try to find more fun stuff to work into THIS one!  And, there is, as usual...plenty to try out and appreciate!  And, oh geeze...I have chatted with, and had sooooo many people test, feedback, etc, that it might take a novelette to thank each and every one of them!  If any of YOU are reading these Release Notes, and want special thanks, just hit me up with a message, so I can amend these notes to include you!!!!!!  Thank you all, your efforts and patience and determination are sooo greatly appreciated, as always:)!  A few Cores were fixed up, such as BlueMSX, Intellivision, etc!  So, if you were having issues with those, in the past, by all means...update to the new and latest fixed versions!

**Release Set Separation Anxiety!:) (All Minis!)**

Some of you have been with me since the beginning of the Mini Classic Scene, and some even "before" that, as far back as projects I have worked on in the 1990s!  It has been a pleasure jumping around from project to project, no matter what the Scene, and seeing "some" of you following me for literally almost 25 years now!  But, in the current grand scheme of things, this "Open World Mod Adventure" is getting a little too big for its britches!  So, in that respect, there will now be 3 Separate Releases, moving forward...starting with THIS timeframe!  One will be for MD/SNES/NES, another for PSC, and lastly, for the Amiga 500 Mini!  I have been meaning to do this for awhile!  So, now, you can grab JUST what you want, for your whichever platform/s of choice!  Links for all of the Releases are hard linked way above at the top of this Release Page:) 

Notes will be shared between them all, since I did what I could to get everything working on all of them, within reason!  And, it is nice to sometimes read about and see what is possible on something else you may be contemplating checking out 
 Note: to grab the MD/SNES/NES Release, you can scroll down way way way to the bottom of these Release Notes, and grab the .7z assets file, NOT the source zip file!  You can also use the alternate links above, as secondary and third, etc, sources!  I am leaving my last 2 Releases' worth of notes here, so those who are fresh into the Mini Scene, on the Amiga 500, can get an idea of some of the amazing stuff that has already been achieved, and is possible!  You can use the alt link for MD/SNES/NES, to view notes over the last few years, for ALL of the nearly 100+ Releases I have done for the Mini Classics, up til this point!  So, carry on my wayward son...and, without much further ado, here we go...everyone:)!!!  You may need a drink and a bag of chips for these Notes:)  Or, maybe a friggin' pizza!   

**MAME 2003 Xtreme More Custom OSTs! (All Minis!)**

Those of you who have had the pleasure of checking out the Custom OSTs within MAME 2003 Xtreme/Plus, pretty much know exactly what to expect with this:)  CD Soundtracks swapped out for the original hardware limited musics of the time:)

Status of the Custom OSTs, as a whole!  Any who are interested in helping finalize and test any of these, feel free to join our Discord and shoot me a ping or pm:)  Over a dozen are currently coded into 2003 Xtreme/Plus, however!  Personal thanks to BigBlueFrontend, Gpstar81, Kurrono, Arcadez2003, Mahoneyt944, Grant2258, MistyDreams and anyone else who has been involved in this amazing side project!

**Amiga 500 Mini RetroAami Xtreme Modification Release! (Amiga 500!)**

This was a long time coming, everyone!  So many variables have made this a little more complicated than the typical Release.  For starters, I didn't even initially have an Amiga 500 Mini!  But, MadFranko was quite persistent that I get one, and get onboard.  It took a little bit of coaxing.  But, once I obliged his offer to "gift me" an Amiga 500, there was no looking back!  He initially was inspired by Team Pandory, in their original implementation of the hack.  But, upon digging further into the semantics of things, it was decided we should go in an entirely different direction.  We both had several real life drama complications keep setting us back!  And, of course, it became a little difficult to fully agree on just WHAT the final version of RetroAami would entail!  We kept talking shop, and running around in circles, on what he wanted to do, and what I wanted to do, hehe.  But, at the end of the day, it was furthermore decided our friendship mattered so much more than RetroAami.  And, here we are!  

You will be able to do many things on the Amiga 500 Mini that you cannot do on other Minis, including running N64, Dreamcast, MAME, etc, significantly better than on the MD/SNES/NES/PSC, as the clock speed is even HIGHER than that of the PSC...at a nifty, roughly 1.8 Ghz!  The main drawback to the system is that it has 512 MB of RAM!  It would have been super nice to have at least 1 GB like the PSC has!  But, it has all worked out, with this amazing Release!  You can try LudicrousN64 Xtreme (My personal N64 Core), MAME 2003 Xtreme, and many other Xtreme Cores, that help performance and speed prevail in many games one might want to play!  You can see many Amiga 500 Demonstrations on my YouTube Channel.  Enjoy!:)  Also, thanks kowa, for helping test things on the Amiga side!!!  You rock:)

**Sonic Mania Decrypted! (Mini MD-SNES!)**

You can "purchase" the game via Steam (20 USD, on sale frequently, however!), etc, legally!  Encore DLC will work, as well.  And, honorably, it would be a wise idea to also purchase that:)  And, it can be run on the Mini SNES/MD, for now:)  You can also run it on the NES Classic, if you have MD/SNES Firmware!  If any of you need help with this more specialized set-up, let me know.  And, I can best guide you and/or do a video tutorial showing how to pull this off!

Yep, what many have considered another impossible thing to run on the Mini Classics, is now very much possible, starting with the SNES and MD Mini Classics!  Personal thanks to DanTheMan827 for his incredible efforts in helping port this over to the Minis, as well as Rubberduckycooly and his team for decompiling the coding of Sonic Mania, Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic CD!!!  Sonic Mania will be their FINAL project.  So, do not expect Sonic 3 to be decrypted anytime soon!

But, for now, SONIC MANIA Plus, hell yeah!:)  I bought this game on my PS4, and it quickly became part of my backlog.  You are seeing me play it for the very first time in this video!  To my surprise, it is easily one of the most fun games I have ever had the pleasure of playing!

To get up and running, download Sonic Mania from Hakchi, Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, and copy the Data.rsdk into the CLV folder that Sonic Mania installs to!  Have fun with this truly phenomenal game:)

**Improved Compatibility for N64 Games! (All Minis!)**

Games like Dr. Mario now work fine with LudicrousN64 Xtreme Accuracy Core!  Frame Buffers aren't fully compatible with the Mini Classics, unfortunately.  So, I had to take some special strides to get some games, such as Dr. Mario to be feasibly playable.  If you had a game with "graphic glitches" before, retest on the Accuracy Build, with this Release!  Pokemon Snap also works.  But, it requires just a little additional special set-up to run.  I will have to do a video on this and a few other special case scenario games:)

**Fantastic SNES Boost! (All Minis!)**

Tired of running SNES games slow?  Some games run incredibly slow, no matter what Core you try them on!  Well, this is no longer a problem.  Mednafen Faust Xtreme, updated for this Release, can run MOST SNES games full speed, including FX, and other such special chip games!  This is now my go to Core for quite a few games.  Even games like Mega Man X2, the Water Stage, handle far better!  It gets even better, as you will see, a little down in these Release Notes!!!

**CAVE SHMUPS Performance Boost FTW! (Mini PSC-Amiga 500!)**

Like Killer Instinct, which I kept poking at, I really really wanted to run CAVE Shmups, such as Deathsmiles, Mushihimesama, Mushihimesama Futari, etc, better on the Minis!  Personal thanks to the FBNEO Team, including dinkc64, who is one of the great developers I have had the pleasure of collaborating with in the past when it came to stuff like the Coleco SGM games!  In any case, I am ecstatic to now have these working "reasonably well".  I did quite a few builds to get this to a point where I deemed things "somewhat playable!"  Lag spikes and slowdown are far less prevalent and much more tolerable.  I will showcase more of "how" this set-up works, if need be, and any of you are piqued enough to dive into the shmup'awesomeness!:)

**MSU-1 CD OSTs SNES Faust Xtreme! (All Minis!)**

MSU-1 AKA a Custom Coding addition by the late, great, byuu, is essentially an add-on that allows one to run Custom FULL CD soundtracks, in lieu of the originals, for many many SNES games!  Typically, attempting to run many of these on the Mini Classics, would have one enduring tremendous lag and slowdowns, especially in Zelda 3!!!  Not anymore!  With Mednafen Xtreme Faust, most of them now run near flawlessly, with little or no slowdown!!!:)  

**MAME 2003 Plus Light Gun Auto Reload! (All Minis!)**

I will for sure have to do a video tutorial on this one, as it is a very nice implementation that Mahoneyt944 helped get up and running, that allows one to Map a Reload Button, so that when you SHOOT with your GUN/Controller/Mouse, it auto jumps off the screen, then right back to the last known position you shot from, upon a reload.  It is one of the absolute best additions that truly helps make Light Gun fare far more enjoyable!!!!

**Killer Instinct MAME 2003 Xtreme/Plus Performance/Speed Boost! (All Minis!)**

This was a really big milestone for me, personally.  In playing Killer Instinct Arcade, I noticed there was a built in cheat, where you could go "double speed".  I thought, what if we took this to the next level, and modified things so that we could utilize this on the "slower Mini Classics", so that we could go triple, quadruple, etc, speed.  And, hell yeah, it paid off in a big way.  Use MAME 2003 Xtreme Cheats, Updated, with R2, and you can now change how fast your P1/P2 Move/Attack!  Obviously, "outdoor" stages with more environmental details, will still be a little rough around the edges.  But, indoor stages are now almost a miracle!  Thanks Mahoneyt944 for your help in converting some of this fun stuff, cheat code wise, as well as Abystus!  Note, to even get to this point with 2003 Xtreme to handle Killer Instinct, I must have gone through a good 200+ builds, to try to get as optimal as I could performance/speed!  This parlayed into fixing up MANY other games, such as the Taito F3 games, too!:)  Darius FTW!

**Marble Madness II Support MAME 2003 Xtreme/Plus! (All Minis!)**

Me, in an Arcade, many years ago...Space Harrier, Badlands (laserdisk), Xybots, Marble Madness!!!  I was in love with the style of gameplay that was Marble Madness, from that point forward.  I was super excited to find that an unreleased version of Marble Madness II turned up.  And, it was even more amazing to have the great help of the MAME 2003 Team, to get this operational in 2003 Xtreme!  Thank you Mahoneyt944, Arcadez2003, and all else involved!!!  Also, thank the original people involved in dumping this masterpiece, and coding it into current MAME!  Just need Kung Fu 2 "unreleased" next:)  

**NES Homebrew "Drow Tactics" Added to Mod Hub (Mini MD-S-NESC!)**

Somehow this fantastic gem of a tactical strategy game escaped my last Release!  Thank you Jonny Manjiro for creating this awesome game!  Do not ever be modest on the fun times you have given me with your creations, that you have spent many many many hours making!  Drow Tactics now added to the Mod Hub!  Showcase of this in action, here!:)

**MAME Arcade LaserDisc Game Time Traveler Support! (Mini PSC!)**

This is one of my personal favorite implementations, as I am very nostalgic when it comes to laserdisk games, such as Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, etc.  This particular game, Time Traveler, is a Live Action game, that sorta plays like the Shadow of the Beast Remake!  I have wanted to run it for many years!  And, it was a pure pleasure to finally get a chance to play it, at home!  I just need to get Konami's Badlands going, and I will be happy!  Badlands is a Western Themed Laserdisk game, with animation similar to COPS and MASK cartoon series!!!

**Atari ST Hatari Xtreme! (All Minis!)**

It was about time I got back to trying to fix this up for the Minis!  The last Core was a mess, with low compatibility, bad sound, and many other issues, including slow, choppy games!  SOO much better now!  Thanks Xyphious for your amazing test results!

**TOS images:**

- TOS104UK - Best for general compatibility
- TOS162UK & TOS206UK - Both work well and may resolve issues with certain games but can cause issues with others
- EmuTOS 1.2.1 has been tested and works well but there are issues with some games loading such as 1943 and Crack Down

**Testing was performed with standard Hatari settings and no tweaks were made to CPU, memory or system type.**

**ROM notes:**

- Hatari supports .ST, .STX and .MSD files
- Disk catalogues such as Automation, Pompey Pirate and Medway Boys have been tested and confirmed working
- Some Atari ST games are slow to load. Pressing L1 will display your current input but the flashing green letter A on the right side of the bar denotes disk activity. If this is flashing is means the ROM is being read and the system has not crashed.
Cannon Fodder, Dungeon Master and Shinobi are a few titles noted to load a little slowly but DO work eventually.
- There big differences in available rom files. Pure rips can be tricky to find, there are a lot of scene/cracker versions available. For example, Wizball has many versions available. Some of which did not work with this release. 
- The majority of the Automation disks, Medway Boys and Pompey Pirate disks work fine.
- Try finding a few versions of each ROM and test to avoid frustration. 
- Many games with cracker menus require a button press to proceed. Usually it will be ESC, Spacebar, F1 or any key.
If a title is loading but you cannot proceed, read the text on screen as it will usually tell you what to press 

**Fully tested games:**

**If you made it this far, thank you for your time!  Enjoy the friggin' Release!**

**04-01-22**

**Who says April 1st has to always be a day to stay alert and avoid pranks!  I have personally decided to make it a fun and awesome day, this time around...by posting the latest Release on it:)**

**First of All!**

Personal thanks to those who have intentionally gone out of their way to prevent me from doing the Xtreme Core Set Releases!  You have inspired me to push more and more boundaries, over time!  In the end, those who are true to themselves, simply shine!  Arnold Schwarzenegger was once told he wouldn't amount to much as an actor.  Boy, did he prove everyone who doubted him wrong:)  Also, thanks to all of those who did support me, and have been with me from the beginning of the Mini Classics' Projects, such as DanTheMan827, Madmonkey, DarkAkuma, AntiFly, and so on!  And, thanks Blacksunshine, Requiem, ReyVGM, MadFranko008, Grant2258, Mahoneyt944, Arcadez2003, for keeping me on my toes, with your exceptional support!  Thanks, Everyone who has shown support!

**Now Then!**

  A lot of things have occurred since the last Release.  For starters, whilst I was working on the last "few" Releases, two of my jobs unfortunately had to either relocate or shut down due to aftershock effects of the economy hit from Covid 19.  Fortunately, the one consolidated to less locations, and I was able to maintain employment once the transition went through.  The other job shut down that specific plant, corporate deciding to outsource to another company.  Management from that location came and visited and we had a group meeting.  We were all offered employment opportunities at the new spot.  Out of over all of the employees, only TWO of us, thus far...have decided to take the plunge!

  Right off the bat, my drive distance to this new job went from 14 minutes to and from to nearly 1 hour to and from.  But, my pay also increased by literally double what I used to make.  I believe the scale of the operation is what may have intimidated the other people from taking on the challenges of the job.  It was like going from working, metaphorically, in a Convenient Store to a Walmart, or a Walmart to an Airport!  In any case, everyone there accepted me and I have adjusted quite nicely!  I mainly just had to change things up, free time wise, so that I could still reasonably work on Updates for these Xtreme Releases:)

**What have I been watching or listening to?**

  Reacher on Amazon Prime was a fun show.  It better captures the spirit of the books (minus the sexual innuendo) than the theatrical versions have.  Watch just the first 2 minutes of episode one, you will immediately know if the show is for you or not!  It reminded me a little of "Banshee", another fantastic show, as well!  I am also both a Star Trek, as well as a Star Wars fan.  I can appreciate good sci fi, and don't need to be a fanboy of one or the other.  

  Picard Season 1, didn't exactly capture my interest as much as Season 2 has, so far.  Reintroducing some classic characters that truly made the original series as unique as it was, reinstated a breath of fresh air into things.  I see they are already doing this with the upcoming "Strange New Worlds", as well...with both younger Pike AND Kirk!  And, in Discovery, they have younger Spock.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  It is almost always gonna work if you bring back loved characters!  This is why spin-offs of TV shows tend to not work as well.  Friends was hugely successful.  But, taking any ONE character of that show and giving them their own show is usually a recipe for disaster!  But, sometimes, it works:)  

  Can you imagine Seinfeld getting spin-offs, with Kramer, Elaine, or George, or even Newman?  One of the most successful spin-offs ever was Family Matters!  It was a spin-off of a very fun show I watched as a kid called Perfect Strangers!  The primary connection between the two shows was the grandmother in Family Matters was the Elevator Hostess in Perfect Strangers!  What is your favorite spin-off show or movie!?

  The Batman was hyped out the wazoo.  But, I still gave it a shot, and thoroughly enjoyed its darker nature!  For the first time, in any Batman Movie, ever, the "corniness" was pretty much non-existent!  HBO Max will have it available on April 19th.  And, I would easily watch it again:)  I can't really get into the Paul Dano giving a performance that "rivals" Heath Ledger's however.  We are talking two completely different styles of acting; two distinctively different character personnas!  On the merits of each of their performances, they were quite effective in drawing you into the story!  Method Acting has always stood out for me as the most fun and overall enjoyable.  Jim Carrey as Andy Kauffman in Man in the Moon, Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, list goes on!  What is your personal favorite method acting performance!  

Speaking of which, I always loved the American Psycho scenario

  Music wise, I will say right now, I never ever really pay attention to lyrics.  Being autistic, I tend to hyper focus on certain things...And, in the case of music, I favor the melody and harmony and general instrumentation.  Play a song for me one single time, I can play it on virtually any instrument you throw in front of me.  Play it 50 times, I still can't sing the lyrics from it!  It is all about the music for me.  

  Ghost, is a doom metal band that has garnered a reputation for having offputting lyrics related to taboo things.  But, like with Lady Gaga, or a multitude of other musicians, it tends to seem to be all about image and what will work and not work with the public.  Subvision, an earlier band with Tobias Forge, the primary component to Ghost, had great music, but did not stick out with "image".  Think way back to the 1980s...We all remember The Cars music videos.  But, whatever happened to Christopher Cross?!  Well, as The Bugles would say, Video Killed the Radio Star...literally!  Same holds true for Ghost...

  One day, I just happened to come across Square Hammer, by Ghost..And, I immediately appreciated their sound.  Again, lyrics don't really mean much to me.  Really only "older folk songs" have lyrics that are so crystal clear, I capture them in my head, anyways:)  Hear any John Denver song, those lyrics are embedded forever, haha.  Final Destination, anyone:)

  Ghost was another band, like Metallica, that had a cult following..But, not a "mass public" following.  BUT, with their newest album, Impera, they have put out an album (I will still call them albums, as I am old school!) that is what Nevermind was to Nirvana; Black Album to Metallica.  From beginning to end, Impera was an absolute joy to listen to.  It transcended many fun elements of 30+ years of musical genres, with one song sparking remnants of Bon Jovi's Runaway...another song sounding like Greta Van Fleet doing a Who song with a crescendo of ELO or Queen doing the chorus, haha.  Call Me Little Sunshine feels like it would fit right in on Metallica's Black Album, in fact!  Check it out for yourself!

**Ghost: Call Me Little Sunshine** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD2m_iqD7dI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD2m_iqD7dI)

**MadFranko008 Resource Center! (Mini MD-S-NESC!)**

Since the very beginning of the Mini Classics, way back to the NESC days, MadFranko008 and myself have been in constant contact, on GBA Temp, Reddit, etc.  He has always been one of the absolutely most valuable assets, as far as testing and feedback on many of the things in my Xtreme Releases!  Here is his resource center, which will help many of you on Mini MD-S-NESC!  Thanks for being such a great mate, MadFranko008!

**MadFranko008 Commonly Asked Questions...!** [https://www.reddit.com/r/RockinTheClassics/comments/r9fvqn/commonly_asked_questions_solutions_guides_hints/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RockinTheClassics/comments/r9fvqn/commonly_asked_questions_solutions_guides_hints/)

**Hakchi2 CE Updated to 3.93! (Mini MD-S-NESC!)**

DanTheMan827 did his usual magic and fixed up the Google Search Images function!  

**Sonic Deconstructed Fix-Ups! (Mini MD-S-NESC!)**

Thanks so much, bslenul, for the fix-ups, making this more universally compatible between MD/SNES/NES!

**FCEUmm Updated Compatibility! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

Dozens upon dozens of games that previously did not work properly, now do!  So, feel free to retest any games that may not have worked before, and you may be pleasantly surprised!  I only applied this to NORMAL FCEUmm, for now.  I will Xtreme Mode Activate it, along with more fixes, for Next Update!

**Commodore Vic-20 Improved! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

You can now run Mega Carts, which are pretty awesome, as they can contain 50 plus Vic-20 Games, in one single go!  Thanks sonninnos for the usual kickassery!

**Alternative PDF Png Support! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

This one is quite simple!  Many have asked whether or not they could run PDFs on the Mini Classics!  The answer is, unfortunately, no.  BUT, you can convert your pdfs, video game manuals, magazines, etc, into .png files...NOT .jpgs.  Once in .png format, which can be easily done with a variety of programs, simply copy them into the same directory.  Once RetroArch is opened.  You can "load content", navigate to the first .png in the directory, and simply click open on it.  It will then set things up into a nifty display set-up, where you can tap "left and right" to quickly scroll through the pictures!  Works great for Nintendo Powers, as in my video demonstration!  To make page viewing most optimal, while looking at these .pngs, go back into RetroArch Settings, Video, Output, Scaling, change temporarily to 1:1!  Once done, change back to Core Provided!  

**Arcade Xtreme Compatibility Boost! (Mini PSC Only!)**

What better way to truly get into 2022, than with MAME 2022 Xtreme, which literally brings compatibility, performance, speed, right into the stratosphere of current times!  This, unfortunately, will ONLY work on Mini PSC, as the MD/SNES/NES are not capable of handing Open GL 3.0 or higher!  BUT, those on the aforementioned systems, will still enjoy a heaping helping of Arcade Awesomeness with this Update!

In Xtras, Arcade, MAME Change Logs, those who like to more closely scrutinize specific changes can read the "thousands" of changes that have happened since MAME 2014, which is the highest that the MD/SNES/NES can run!  That would be at the 0.159 cut off point!  Anything above that is viable to the PSC!

Also, in Xtras, Arcade, Compatibility, is a nifty set of "internet browser" openable files that will give you a good rule of thumb for what works and what does not!  

**DOOM HD Xtreme! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

After careful analysis and testing, I was able to arrive at a nice combination of performance, speed, loading times, all with the HD component, as in Higher Definition, for the latest PrBoom Release!  It perfectly compliments the various DOOM Games/Mods you can run on the Core, as you will soon see!

**Hyper MAME/FBNEO?! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

What the hell is Hyper MAME/FBNEO, you may ask?  Well, like many things I post, it isn't so much about the name, as it is about the on the fly effects!  In this case, MAME/FBNEO...are both capable of surpassing anything you've ever yet done on the Minis, once you understand how the formula system works!  The formulas are on the basis of math that I decided upon for the Mini Classics, for the Xtreme Cores.  This takes into account the overall specs of MD-SNES-NES-PSC!  And, due to the varying accuracies, things had to be changed up accordingly, case by case scenario!  

As an example, if you run Ninja Baseball Batman on FBNEO, with THIS Update, the game will run 45 percent faster and better than it ever did before...with or without Xtreme OverClock (OC only applicable to MD/SNES/NES!)  I will cover more about these formulas within the context of very near future video tutorials and demonstrations!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Nintendo PlayChoice-10! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

I have already established a solid spot on the lower spec Minis for MAME 2003 Xtreme.  Arcade Hardware is generally more powerful than NES hardware.  So, with the adaptability of Xtreme Performance/Speed within 2003 Xtreme, (Arcade PlayChoice-10) NES games will run better than they ever have before for you.  Keep in mind, 2003 Xtreme is all about performance and speed!  If you can't handle the sheer intensity of playing Gradius with absolutely ZERO slowdown, then maybe just go back to the more relaxed pace of playing Animal Crossing:)

**MAME 2014 Xtreme! (Mini MD-S-NESC!)**

Oh, you thought you MD-S-NESC Users were !@#$ out of luck, this time?  Nope, you will also get to enjoy more improved emulation, particularly with MAME 2014 Xtreme and...

**MESS Xtreme! Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

You will have exceptionally precise "stereo equalizer" like control of the top tier Arcade/MESS Cores, wherein you can "formula" custom scenario setup each specific game to best adapt to the environment you are running within!  I fixed this up, accordingly, for the various Cores, such as LudicrousN64 Xtreme, Mednafen Beetle, MAME 2003 Xtreme, Opera (3DO), over the preceding Releases!  But, this time around, it will be more optimally prominent for the later Arcade Cores, such as MAME 2014 Xtreme and MESS Xtreme for the MD-S-NESC, and MAME 2015 Xtreme, MAME 2016 Xtreme, MAME 2022 Xtreme, MESS 2022 Xtreme, for the PSC!  Again, Video Tutorials will show up on my YouTube on how to properly run these!  ANY game you are questionable about, feel free to ask!  There are bonus perks to this implementation...But, first, let's talk about something else hella cool that I am especially happy about making this Release!

**NES Homebrews! Drow Tactics & Cur Manor!**

Requiem has tuned me more into better appreciating homebrew games, in general.  After seeing the 1000th Super Mario Bros. 1 palette swap hack, the right game/s had to truly make it across my path to better focus on actually taking them seriously!  Slowly, but surely, I am seeing homebrews really are just as good as "retail developers", if not better, in many cases.  Remember, studios tend to have executives from companies "pushing" them to the direction of losing creative control.  This has classically damaged more than a few companies.  Remember Titus, who made Superman 64?  The originally intended Superman 64 Game was FAR superior to the end result.  But, last minute studio exec pressure made them have to (ET Atari 2600 develop in just 3 weeks time) quickly change the entire scheme of how the game was on a fundamental level!  Just imagine Call of Duty, then them saying, "welp, you can't shoot people anymore.  You gotta change all guns to chicken drumsticks!"  

I had the pleasure of trying out the 2 followup "beta and/or prototypes" for the true Superman 64 on N64/PS1, which were considerably better.  Remember, as beta or protos, they were certainly nowhere near what could have potentially been even far better end results.  But, what they both entailed, literally flew circles around the unpolished turd that was Superman 64 on N64!  I remember, knowing JUST how bad Superman 64 was...And, then I happened to find it in a bargain bin for 5 USD, and said to myself.  Is it really "THAT" bad?  I bought it, played it, gave it a solid chance.  I used the "level skip" code to see ALL stages in the game.  And, damn, it really was THAT bad!  I truly commend Titus Developers for not accidentally "losing" all coding for the game, when they were told to change it to crappier perimeters:)!  

Definitely check out Superman 64 beta/proto for N64 AND PS1.  See what COULD have been!

Back to the homebrews, I was checking out a few homebrew demonstrations on YouTube, and came across a few by Jonny Manjiro, which shined a bright light my way.  They are called Cur Manor, ROOMS, and Drow Tactics; Shmup influenced, precise platforming based, Strategy Tactics styled, respectively!  I commended and complimented him on the tremendous job he put forth into these games!  And, I asked for permission to share them with the several thousand Mini Classic Users, so they could try these incredibly fun gems!  He was, at first, a little shy about them, especially Cur Manor...due to thinking he could have done better.  But, in the way of the movie Whiplash!  Perfection is never gonna be your best!  Just knowing or thinking you didn't do well enough, is being modest enough to warrant true excellence in life.  I didn't feel any need to throw metaphorical drumsticks at Jonny.  But, I criticized him, briefly, for downplaying how great he did a job on these.  They all 3 stood head and shoulders above a majority of fan made or homebrew games, that were a dime a dozen!  I could easily put an hour or more into any or all 3 of these!

In any case, I asked him a little about the background, as far as how he got into creating and developing his own homebrews.  And, this is what he had to say:)

"After seeing Michael Chiaramonte's Zero Pages series on NES development in my YouTube feed, I decided it was finally time to take a stab at my lifelong dream of making an NES game. I then went on to go through the Nerdy Nights Tutorials and get some hands on experience with coding in assembly using the NESASM3 compiler. Not having much experience with coding other than BASIC, it was quite difficult in the early stages, but little by little I learned the basic commands, and after a couple months of study and practice I was able to port over a couple games I had coded in BASIC about 7 years ago: ROOMS and Drow Tactics. Between coding those games, I also made a new game called Cur Manor, which was inspired by the old Muse Castle Wolfenstein computers on the Apple."

Final note is to personally thank Damien@Famiconmaniac for the fantastic artwork for all 3 games in the Mod Hub!  

Those of you on PSC can grab these via the normal routine methods online.  Or, if you want to up the ante a little, you can download Hakchi2 CE Portable Edition, whether or not you even have a MD/SNES/NESC, and utilize it as a game manager:)  Once opened, modules, KMFD Mod Hub, Games Tab, to download 50+ games that can be used on PSC!  Speaking of NES:)

**DefKorns Theme Selector (Mini SNES-NESC!)**

For those of you who want the nifty ability to "switcheroo" your main menu Theme on the SNES or NES Classics, here ya go!  It includes features, such as:

- Graphical interface to allow you to select themes
- Download themes directly from the internet (Wi-Fi mod required)
- Theme randomizer (Off by default)
- Audio randomizer on home folder (Off by default)
- Set theme per folder (keeping the same the per sub-folder)
- Create a theme based your existent theme resources
- Custom fonts per theme
- Select a theme for the entire system
- Select a theme just for the home folder
- Custom icons for Option Menu

Thanks for the great addition, DefKorns!  Many will appreciate it:)

**DefKorns Theme Selector [SNES-NES]** [https://github.com/DefKorns/om_theme-selector/wiki/](https://github.com/DefKorns/om_theme-selector/wiki/)

**Atari Jaguar Improvements (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

Remember, Atari Jaguar has never been very feasible, as far as being taken seriously on the Mini Classics.  It is simply too troublesome a Core to remotely run that many games well!  BUT, with MESS Xtreme, we can now run a dozen plus games fair to reasonably well...general compatibility list is as follows: 

- Air Cars
- AVP: Alien vs. Predator
- Breakout 2000
- Brutal Sports Football
- Bubsy
- Cannon Fodder
- Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story
- Doom
- Double Dragon V
- Evolution: Dino dudes
- Hyper Force
- Pinball Fantasies
- Raiden
- Rayman
- Sensible Soccer: International Edition
- Syndicate
- Tempest 2000
- Troy Aikman Football
- Zero 5
- Zool 2

**Philips CD-i Improved! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

MESS Xtreme, yet again, helping make games...such as Mario Hotel, Zelda: Wand of Gamelon, Link: Faces of Evil, and so on, run fair to reasonably well:)  Video Tutorials for CD-i, as well as the preceding Atari Jaguar will be done for my YouTube, soon enough!

**MAME 2015/2016/2022 Xtreme! (Mini PSC Only!)**

Essentially, MAME 2015/2016/2022 are all much more accurate than the usual Arcade Cores you'd expect to run on the Mini Classics' lower specs!  But, with the Hyper Xtreme implementation, many games are far more accessible and playable than ever before.  Games like the awesome brawler, Crystal of Dragons, are actually quite playable, now!  Several stubborn games will benefit from running on any or all 3 of these special case scenario Cores!  You can also run some of the Arcade Hard Drive Image Games, which typically are FAR too slow to even consider, under normal circumstances.  But, here and now, with this Update, you can run nearly 60 of them!  Huge and tremendous personal thanks to both walknight and Nukleari for their roles in helping me reach my goals with these amazing higher tier rollouts!  Speaking of which:

**MAME Arcade Laserdisc Support! (Mini PSC Only!**

Daphne is one of the primary ways of trying to run Arcade Laserdisc games on the Minis.  BUT, the Core does not currently and properly work with sound!  Dragon's Lair and Space Ace are simply not as fun without sound!  Luckily, there are alternative means to run many of these games!  Dragon's Lair has a gem of a port on PSP, which runs amazingly well with the PPSSPP Xtreme or PPSSPP Xtreme Amped Cores!  Other games, such as Road Avenger, Cobra Command, Revenge of the Ninja, etc., run well with their Sega-CD counterparts!

But, here we are, yet again...with another nice bonus...ability to run nearly a half dozen laserdiscs with MAME 2022 Xtreme!  Within Xtras/Arcade/mame_hard_drive_compat.png, you can peruse a nifty list of several hard drive games that boot and run, for better or worse!  Personal thanks to GlassArrow for compiling the list!

The laserdisc games, on the list, that work...are:

I will do a video tutorial on how to set these up, as well!  But, briefly, you will need, at a minimum an NTFS drive.  Fat32 will NOT work, due to inability to have files over 4 GB in size, of which Laserdisc Games are!  You will need the actual rom.zip for whichever laserdisc game in the same directory as a folder, which is identically named to that game.  And, inside that folder, would be the .chd hard drive image file!  IE: firefox.zip, firefox folder with firefox.chd inside!  Again, I will get a video tutorial up for this, as well as several other aspects covered within this Release.  So, definitely stay tuned:)  Note: Laserdisc games will be a slight Work in Progress, as I need to do a little more work to touch them up!  But, they ARE working:)

**Super Bros War/Jump n' Bump Cores! (War Mini PSC Only!)**

For now, Super Bros War will only work for Mini PSC.  There are a few build errors to resolve regarding that implementation for MD/SNES/NES!  Those on PSC will need the actual Mario War Game data files, and can then use a "dummy" file, with an extension named .game.  (Google Drive/XXtras/Games) Thanks to all who have worked on Super Bros War, as well as the specialized levels, including jjames!  So, for example, dummy.game or whatevs.game, etc!  Then, simply loading the dummy file, while within same directory as the data files, you will trigger the base game!  Additional levels can be created, added, etc, into the maps folder!  I will do a tutorial on all this fun stuff!  The most beautiful thing is that it has a culmination of many years worth of work, which clearly shows in its overall execution and quality!  Plus, you can play against AI opponents, in the event you do not have anyone else to combat against!  Personal thanks to the original creator of Mario War, Samuele Poletto, which was made in 2002.  A couple years later, Florian Hufsky started working on an open source rewrite, which became the Super Mario War we now know and love.  Unfortunately, tragic circumstances occurred, which led to the premature end of Florian's life.  I cannot stress this enough, if YOU ever feel down or sad, do not hesitate to reach out to someone.  Life is too precious to take one's own life!

After Florian's passing, Michael Schaffer carried on the torch and tradition, keeping the spirit of the game as best alive as he could.  It was eventually ported over to Github, and here we are now, running this on the Mini Classics.  So much thanks goes to both Mátyás Mustoha AKA mmatyas and Philippe Simons AKA loki666 for making this possible on other platforms, especially the Mini Classics!

For Jump n' Bump, it works on ALL of the current Minis I do Releases for!  Simply load the .map files with the Core.  Personal thanks to all whom have worked on Jump n'Bump Levels!  They are in my Google Drive/XXtras/Games!

Unfortunately, this is only playable against human opponents, for now, unless you wanna clone your controller and play against yourself, like in my video demonstration!  Thanks again to [Brainchild Design, the original development for this game, and felixhaedicke, Philippe Simons AKA loki666, and anyone else who put forth efforts into this amazing project, for the libretro implementation!

**Konami/Nintendo/Sega/Tiger/Etc. Handheld! (Mini PSC Only!)**

This is not going to be possible on anything but the Mini PSC, for now!  But, with this fantastic Release, we can now play over 100+ various handheld games from Konami, Nintendo, Sega, Tiger, and so on!  Fun, fun times!  I remember these being great time passers when I was in school, as well as on the bus ride to school!  Nostalgic wise, many of them hold up well, with quick pick me up gameplay, that is a minute to learn, lifetime to master!  Some are actually quite intricate in overall conceptual design, like pinball fare!  Some of the great handhelds you can now play, include:

**Handheld Alternatives! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

Several of the aforementioned Handheld Games are also playable via other means, such as the Game & Watch Core, with their respective simulations!  And, the Zelda one, can be unlocked in ONE of the Nintendo Game & Watch GBA games, namely Game & Watch Gallery 4!

**Handheld Authentic Artwork! (Mini PSC Mainly!)**

What better way to convey the awesomeness and true spirit of these magnificent handheld games, than also having handheld artwork to boot!  These files take up GBs worth of data size.  But, I was able to losslessly compress them into much more approachable install sizes.  I will update the "injector" for this implementation to cover more and more games, whether or not I am waiting for the Next Release!  So, check back periodically on the link, and my actual Github Release Page, for non-Release earlier Updates to Google Drive!  For now, go to Google Drive, XXtras/Xtreme MAME 2022/ install the _km_psc_xtreme_mame_art_injector.exe  And, then, you will get nifty and authentic handheld artworks for a multitude of handheld games!

**MAME Shortcuts! Cheats!? (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

Several of the Arcade Cores, as well as MESS, have special shortcuts to open the MAME Menu.  IE: R2 for MAME 2003 Xtreme, L2 for MAME 2014/2015, select+X for MAME 2022 Xtreme!  I will DEFINITELY cover the nuances of how to properly use these, as well as the formulas, so you can best enjoy the more stubborn games.  Cheats can also be utilized for 2003 Xtreme, 2022 Xtreme, and so on!   

**Xtreme Virtual Ram! (Mini MD-S-NESC!)**

Depending on what kind of flash/hard drive you have, Xtreme Virtual Ram may potentially have trouble installing.  So, I devised a workaround to ensure you can run it, even without installing the virtual ram swap file portion!  Simply go to my Google Drive, XXtras, Virtual Ram, download, extract, and COPY the XtremeVirtualRam file directly to your flash or hard drive...THEN, install the Xtreme Virtual Ram from the Mod Hub, Xtras!  Note, Virtual Ram ONLY works if you use a flash or hard drive.  Hope this helps anyone who has had difficulty installing it!  Personal thanks to AntiFly for his tremendous help and support in testing this and many other things over the last several years, Mini Classic Release wise!

**PicoDrive Xtreme! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

Thanks for all the feedback related to PicoDrive over the last few Releases.  We are now going more Xtreme with PicoDrive, with better performance, speed, sound, and better playability overall!  Enjoy!

**MAME 2003 Plus Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Plus Beta 2! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

_km_Xtras/MXYZPTLK/UMK3PB2_CL.PDF, contains a comprehensive list of all of the changes that have been painstakingly done to Ultimate MK3 Plus Beta 2 (umk3pb2.zip), including:

- Improved Factory User Settings
- Improved CPU AI
- Tag-Team Mode 
- Bug Fixes
- New Audio Soundbytes & Palette Swapping
- All Levels Unlocked & New Levels Added
- All Characters Unlocked (Ermac and Human Smoke)
- New Characters (Rain, Noob Saibot, Chameleon, etc)
 
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Plus Beta 2 was extensively worked on by TEHDREWSUS and ZPAUL2FRESH8 with Development Tools by ABYSTUS and BRE.  Other credits are on the first page of the PDF!  Mind blown by the sheer amount of effort and work that went into sprucing things up into one of the truly most Ultimate Fighting Games one could ever hope to have an Arcade Mini Classic Experience with!  Have fun!

MAME 2003 Plus also has quite a few other additions and fix ups since last Release, including Kaneko (Fixed missing adpcm sounds in Pack 'n Bang Bang, Hooked up the sound correctly for Blood Warrior, Support a missing sprite effect used in Magical Crystals for the first boss), pgm fix ups, music and sfx evening out for better overall sound for Air Buster, 1945KIII sound and video improvements, DJ Boy Japan Version Supported, and so on!  I will try to showcase some of these in very near future videos! Huge thanks to arcadez2003, mahoneyt944, grant2258, for all their continual efforts in making Plus such a fantastic feat of a Core!  

**RetroArch Xtreme! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

For MD/SNES/NES Classics, you can use RetroArch Xtreme SC 184 or 1910 if you want to truly trigger the Xtreme perimeters of the Cores, so you can better run 3DO (Opera Xtreme), Dreamcast (Flycast Xtreme), MAME 2003 Xtreme, etc.  Those who just wanna run stuff like NES, MD, SNES, a majority of games are fine with Ozone Build of RetroArch.  If you want to run NES, MD, SNES with little or no slowdown, however...Xtreme is the way to go!

For PSC, simply install AutoBleem Xtreme, then the Xtreme Injector, as per my latest Video Tutorial!  This will get you up and running with the Xtreme Core Set with all the fixings, such as Xtreme, Turbo, Hyper!

**P-UAE Xtreme! Amiga! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

You will notice, or may have already...that some Cores follow tiers, as in this case, P-UAE Xtreme, P-UAE Xtreme Amped, P-UAE Xtreme Accuracy!  I do this because certain perimeters are not exactly feasible to consolidate within one singular Core.  I have done this, in the past, with Cores, such as MAME 2003 Xtreme!  There were times when I had Final Fight Custom CD Samples in the Core, but still had to fix up System 32 Games, such as Golden Axe: Revenge of Death Adder!  You get the idea:)  In THIS case, P-UAE Xtreme is the most stable of the Xtreme implementation, personally has sign of approval from the most knowledgeable mate I know, MadFranko008...who has been an invaluable asset for critique and improvements and adjustments I should attempt to get in to some of these Cores for the best overall experience!

In any case, Xtreme is for those who like to use .uae files, and are more advanced with their Amiga fortitude!  Xtreme Amped has a turbo boost applied, in addition to Xtreme, which helps run Amiga 1200/AGA games better, plus, can run "without BIOS!"  Note, running without BIOS is not the best way to go.  But, it is available as an option for those less savvy to the more advanced Amiga emulation!  You would need either Amped or Accuracy to run without BIOS, in addition to the WHDLoad from BIOS Tab in Mod Hub for MD/SNES/NES Classics; Xtreme Injector auto installs it for PSC!

If you are a purist and use custom WHDLoad.hdf files, be sure to back them up before attempting to use any of the Amiga Cores/DUMMY WHDLoad.hdf I provide, just in case you want to revert back to them.  Personal thanks to sonninnos, especially, as well as anyone else involved with P-UAE coding!  

**Otherwise, what else?! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC!)**

Being that the Mini Classics are truly getting to an impasse, where it becomes more and increasingly difficult to truly push boundaries, do not expect any true miracles (PS2 or Gamecube, etc!  Most of what comes, moving forward, will be "fan focused" (your requests!) or what I personally decide as a fun challenge to attempt to work in.  

There are many other things added in this Release, that would simply take much more, Release Note wise...to cover.  QuickNES, several others, got nifty Updates!  But, sooo much to truly try to cover...So, I will just try to do videos on these, as well as tutorials.  So, it will end up being in the vein of...from your perspective..."Wow, didn't know I could run or do this...It is already in the Release!  Hell yeah!"  You will also discover many surprises on your own mod adventures with This Release.  So, til Next Time, Enjoy!  And, thanks so much for your continual support and comments, subscribing to my YouTube, watching the videos, all that fun stuff!  

**KMFDMania AKA Kyland K!**

**01-08-22**

Hello, again, everyone!  The Release was a success.  I have received quite a bit of great and nice feedback, thus far!  But, you gotta break a few eggs to make a mod omelette, so to speak.  So, here we are, with a few more additions, as well as "fix-ups!"  If you haven't already joined us on Reddit or Discord, MadFranko008, who has been a truly valuable asset in the Mini Scene from Day 1!...has an excellent post which covers a lot of Mini Classic Information, including troubleshooting, N64 Compatibility, and much much more, at:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RockinTheClassics/comments/r9fvqn/commonly_asked_questions_solutions_guides_hints/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RockinTheClassics/comments/r9fvqn/commonly_asked_questions_solutions_guides_hints/)

MadFranko008 is quite articulate when it comes to sharing his knowledge of Emulation AND Real Hardware.  So, don't hesitate to drop in on the aforementioned topic, anytime!  Quite a few great people always around, who are very helpful, be it Reddit/Discord!

**TV/Movie Wise**

I finished Cobra Kai Season 4, Dexter Season 9, Chucky Season 1.  I had fun with all 3!  I will likely try to get into Ray Donovan, as the movie is coming out soon.  And, 1883 and Yellowstone!  I am still finishing up Sanford and Son on Peacock.  And, kind of funny.  But, my phone was in my pocket, and randomly opened up Tubi, and when I looked at the screen, it was on the spinoff series Sanford, which came out in 1980, heh.  What is interesting about this show, was that his partner is a very fun "character" actor, whom you may have seen in countless tv shows, movies, as a "bad biker dude".  I am talking about Dennis Burkley.  Dennis Burkley, within Sanford, sparks quite a bit of John Belushi and Chris Farley vibes. Here is a tribute to this great, unfortunately, taken from this world...far before his time...actor!  My personal favorite appearance of his was in an episode of The Greatest American Hero, where he "steals" the "superhero suit" and tries to figure out how to use it:)

- Dreamcast BIOS Changes! (PSC)
- PicoDrive Fixed!
- AutoBleem Fixed! (PSC)
- Sexy Time!
- Earthbound 2 Deluxe Support Added!
- P-UAE Xtreme Updated!
- DOOMsday!
- Brutal Doom HD!
- Intellivision!
- MSX!
- Anything Else!?
- What's Next?

**Dreamcast BIOS Changes! (PSC)**

Dreamcast BIOS need to "now" be in two locations for the Playstation Classic.  They are in retroarch/system/dc and in retroarch/system And, the important BIOS include:

- awbios.zip (Atomiswave)
- dc_boot.bin (Dreamcast)
- dc_flash.bin (Dreamcast)
- naomi.zip (Naomi MAME Versions)
- naomi_boot.bin (Naomi .lst/.dat Versions)

If you do not have the BIOS in "both" locations, you will have issues running Atomiswave and Naomi Games; And, Dreamcast Games will fall back to "HLE" Bios, which has lesser overall compatibility.  So, make absolute sure, again, to copy the above listed BIOS into retroarch/system/dc as well as retroarch/system 

**PicoDrive Fixed!**

A little oversight caused a break in the build.  Thanks to everyone who had informed me of this.  Fixed and much better version is now posted for MD/SNES/NES on Mod Hub, as well as for PSC, within the Xtreme Core Injector!  Have fun running 32x games, better than ever before, such as Virtua Racing, Virtua Fighter, and Spider-Man!  Genesis GX Wide also fixed:)

**AutoBleem Fixed! (PSC)**

Cat bumped the keyboard!  Somehow, the pass, which should have been kmfd...was incorrect:)  I will blame the cat!  In any case, AutoBleem is reuploaded with this Update, and pass of kmfd now functions fine:)  Sorry for any inconvenience!

**Sexy Time!**

If you want a real laugh, and some total coolness factor, audio filters have now been added...so that you can take on many previous or new games, in varied and interesting ways!  Simply download one of the Updated RetroArchs from Mod Hub, then install via modules tab, for MD/SNES/NES.  For PSC, install the updated Xtreme Core Injector.  Once a game is loaded, simply go into RetroArch Settings, Audio, tap up once to be at the bottom of the options.  Then, you will see an Audio Filter selection, once picked, choose whichever you would like to try out!  You can disable them by simply using "delete filter" or "tapping start".  

WahWah makes any game sound like its straight out of a 1970s adult film.  Try it with Mad City, which is the Japan version of Adventures of Bayou Billy.  The reason I recommend the Japan version over the US one, is that they made the US one 10 times more difficult than the preceding!  The reason for this is because video game rentals were legal in US, which would typically cause people to rent a game, beat it, then never actually buy it.  So, some companies, such as Konami, Tecmo, and so on, made US counterparts much more incredibly difficult than the Japan Variants!  IE: Mad City is way easier than Bayou Billy; Ninja Gaiden 3 Japan also has unlimited continues and enemies aren't bullet sponges!  US version is very difficult, and has limited continues!  

In any case, enjoy these amazing filters!  I also added some video filters.  But, most of them hurt performance and speed.  But, they are there if you want to try them out!  You can see the one I use in my demonstration of Mad City, works out quite nicely!  Personal thanks to Nathan Ruins His Future for testing, as well as suggesting this addition.  And, of course, thanks to all who worked on the audio/video filters to begin with!  You rock!

**Mother 2 Deluxe Support Added!**

It was brought to my attention that the Mother 2 Deluxe "rom hack" had issues running on the Minis, by salhaney.  The reason for it having problems was due to its 6 MB size, which is a bit too large and confusing for the SNES Cores to properly read!  With this Update, you can run the patched version, fine, with the SNES9x Core.  I will probably add the fix to some of the other SNES Cores, in a future Update.  But, it ran absolutely fine, without issues, on normal SNES9x, which for MD/SNES/NES, command line will be /bin/snes9x or /bin/km_snes9x  On PSC, simply load it directly with SNES9x!  Have fun!  The original patch information is at:

[https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2518/](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2518/)

So, you can use the specified rom version, and apply the patch using the EBPatcher from:

[https://github.com/Lyrositor/EBPatcher](https://github.com/Lyrositor/EBPatcher)

Personal thanks to those who worked on the rom hack patch, as well as the EBPatcher!  I also included both the patch, as well as the patch program, in Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING/SNES!

**P-UAE Xtreme Updated!**

Personal thanks to sonninnos for continuing to kick ass with Amiga Coding Additions!  And, thanks MadFranko008 for your amazing insight into Amiga, period!  With THIS Release, you have 3 paths to follow for P-UAE.  One, /bin/puae-xtreme for stable, fast, nice, performance; /bin/puae-xtreme-amped for less stable, but "faster" for several games; /bin/puae-xtreme-accuracy for more stable and accurate Amiga Emulation.  Given time, this may end up being ONE Command Line.  But, for now, this covers all the bases!  You can also use UAE4ARM as an alternative, which can run some games even faster, particularly the Amiga 1200 Games!  No matter the case, you have 4 distinctively different paths now:)  And, Amiga will continue to be updated in future Releases!

One important reminder note, regarding P-UAE.  Of the three, P-UAE Xtreme is the most optimal for usage with .uae files and "custom" WHDLoad.hdf (bios injected within) files.  .uae files are mostly phased out for P-UAE Xtreme Amped/Accuracy.  And, WHDLoad.hdf does not, at all, need BIOS inside it!  You can simply copy and paste the kickstarts directly into etc/libretro/system via FTP (or use Master BIOS Module!) for MD/SNES/NES, and install the WHDLoad.hdf dummy BIOS file from Mod Hub, BIOS Tab!  For PSC, just install AutoBleem, Xtreme Core Injector, then copy the kickstarts to retroarch/system/  These kickstarts are:

- kick34005.A500 (Amiga 500)
- kick40063.A600 (Amiga 600)
- kick40068.A1200 (Amiga 1200)
- kick40060.CD32, kick40060.CD32.ext (Amiga CD32)
-  kick34005.CDTV (Amiga CDTV)

This being said, the HLE AROS are a method of running Amiga Games more easily for those who are less savvy when it comes to .uae files and injecting BIOS into WHDLoad.hdf!:)  What this means, is that with Amped/Accuracy, if you do NOT have BIOS, the games will still run (You still need WHDLoad.hdf, dummy, at a minimum), just not as well as WITH BIOS:)  So, again, you all have options!  Thanks again, MadFranko008 for your countless hours of insight and wisdom into Amiga awesomeness:)

**DOOMsday!**

Moving forward, starting with This Release, DOOMsday is coming, past, present, and future:)  Awesome name for Rob Zombie Compilation of Hits, too!  In any case, you will have "some" DOOM Mods pop up on the Mod Hub, within hakchi, as well as have an alternative means of checking them out on Google Drive, within, _km_XXtras/GAMES/DOOM!  Make sure to view the ReadMe! there.  It will give you information on prerequisites, as well as means to run these on MD/SNES/NES, as well as PSC!  Personal thanks to Lake-Debris and BlackSunshine for their help in collaboration on this DOOM Project, as well as ALL people who have worked on the Mods, as well as PrBoom, GZDoom/ZDoom, and the original developers of  id Software and John Romero!  Lake-Debris, BlackSunshine, and myself, have already invested dozens of hours into getting many of these Mini Classic Worthy and Ready!  So, expect to see more and more pop up, as time progresses!  

**Brutal Doom HD!**

Here is where things get really interesting.  Many things that we add tend to be set up in such a way, so that we can build upon them!  Brutal Doom was gotten to run on the Minis by swingflip/compcom a few years ago.  Appreciation for their original efforts!  But, back then, the environments for the MD/SNES/NES/PSC weren't quite as optimal or reliable, in some aspects.  This made it a little more difficult to get away with running Brutal Doom in HD, without having major slowdown or running into a slideshow.  But, with how things are now, it runs quite nicely in HD, for all of the Minis!

I have optimized Brutal Doom with a few Xtreme Tweaks.  Personal thanks to bslenul for the custom child script, which makes special loading on MD/SNES/NES more optimal!  In any case, for MD/SNES/NES, simply download Brutal Doom from the KMFD Mod Hub, then copy and paste DOOM.WAD (Full Retail Version) into the CLV's zDOOM_files folder.  In order for this build to boot, you will be required to first grab one of the updated RetroArchs, also in Mod Hub, download from that location, then install from Modules, install additional modules.  Once you follow these steps, Brutal Doom HD will boot!  

For PSC, have AutoBleem and Xtreme Core Injector installed to SONY formatted flash/harddrive (Fat32 usually works fastest and easiest!) Then, navigate to _PSC/_AB/_RB_APPS/ and install the RB_1.1_PATCH_brutal_doom_hd_0.1.exe to your flash/hard drive.  Make sure to then go to retroarch/apps/compat/lzdoom_brutal/WAD, and copy DOOM.WAD there, in order to successfully be able to boot Brutal Doom HD!  Once you start up your Playstation Classic, tap Start at the AutoBleem Menu, then Select, til you see the Apps, choose Brutal Doom, then, you should have the game load up fine, as long as you've followed all above steps!

To run additional games, you can create your own launchers, which I may need to do a video tutorial on, and/or instructions in THIS ReadMe!  But, for now, you can simply navigate to retroarch/apps/compat/lzdoom_brutal/  And, let's take Simon's Destiny, as an example game! To get that up and running, create a _TEMP folder within lzdoom_brutal, and Cut and Paste your DOOM.WAD, doom2.wad, if they exist, from WAD, into _TEMP; Also, brutalv20b_mmc.pk3 from lzdoom_brutal, to _TEMP.  The reason these need to be moved out of the "load" area, is so that Simon's Destiny takes precedence in the loading grand scheme of things.  Simon's is a special game that does not require a Base.Wad, such as DOOM.WAD or doom2.wad! brutalv20b_mmc.pk3, however, is a game that DOES require a Base.Wad  And, if you leave it within the lzdoom_brutal directory, it will attempt to load it, since it is the "first" in order!  So, _TEMP helps ensure Simon's loads fine!  Other games require their own special set-ups, depending on whichever! I will update the ReadMe, as well as do Videos, showcasing more of these scenarios! 

The ReadMe! is located in_km_Xtras/DOOM  Enjoy Brutal Doom, as well as PrBoom!  Thanks are also in order for id Software|John Romero|Sergeant Mark IV (Marcos Abenante).  We all know about id Software and John Romero and their wondrous (love this word now that Letterkenny made it fun again!) legacy.  Marcos Abenante is the one who worked on Brutal Doom!  And, thanks to everyone else who has had a hand in DOOM Mods!:)

**Intellivision!**

If Intellivision wasn't enough nostalgic coolness for the Last Release, we now have fixed up controls, with right analog handling all the number keys, along with unmapped functions being auto mapped to the controller.  This makes things far more optimal for a great play experience!  Just check out Deadly Discs of Tron, to see for yourself, along with the Dungeons & Dragons Games!  Border Collisions, as well as Lock & Chase sound chirping also fixed up!  Thanks msheehan79, nanochess! 

**MSX!**

fMSX is vastly better, with refined controls that are easily mapped from keyboard to controller, as well as Cheats Support, .m3u, and many other fix ups!  Thanks,  cayce-msx!

**Anything Else!?**

A few other fixes and optimizations made it into the Release.  These will show up in Video Tutorials on my YouTube, to make it most easy to understand how the process works for getting these up and running on your end!  And, moving forward, more DOOM Mods for PrBoom, as well as Brutal Doom AKA GZDoom/ZDoom!  More Mod Hub Games, and so much more:)  Enjoy this follow-up Update!  Thanks for all the feedback, all of you!  You made fixing things up much more accessible!

**What's Next?**

Ultimately, it is a combination of what you all want to see, as well as what comes to mind, on my end!  I would very much like to fix up Atari Jaguar, as well as Philips CD-i emulation, have Outfoxies running even better, along with DeathSmiles, etc!  I may do a little more work with N64, including X1, X2, X3 Hyper Boosted Cores!  We have Xtreme, Amped, Turbo...Next in line, Hyper!  Just imagine a Ludicrous Xtreme Amped Turbo Hyper Core, haha:)  LXATHC:)  There may possibly be an Updated RetroArch for PSC.  This remains to be determined, as far as bugginess is concerned!

KM:)

**01-03-22**

**TL;DR**

If you don't want to sit back and read all of these Updated Notes, you can just go to my YouTube Channel, and look back through videos dating back to Sept '21, to see the gist of what made it into this Update, minus "Brutal Doom!"

**Happy New Year!  What is your New Year's Resolution?**

Personally, I have never had one.  But, I have seen people go through the whole gamut of them, such as attempting to bid farewell to drinking, smoking, losing weight, and so on.  All of the aforementioned are very challenging to endure and undertake!  But, if any of you have decided on those, or anything else, for that matter...I wish you all the best in success!  As for me, I guess I will just make my resolution to keep helping to "Rockin' The Classics" for another year!

**Good Times, Bad Times**

A kickass Led Zeppelin song!  But, in the grand scheme of things, not always gonna be the best for "certain" Cores on the Mini Classics!  The Graphics Libraries are pushing in a direction for quite a few Cores, with which they are simply not easily supported on the Mini Classics.  MD/SNES/NES can only handle the 2.0 OpenGL range; PSC 3.0.  As a result, certain Cores, such as Flycast/Mupen Xtreme, and so on...are becoming increasingly less compatible for us.  In order to "make" them work, things would have to be potentially broken til the point of it being best just using the current posted versions!  More on this, as the Release Notes unfold!  

Before we get into the good stuff, I will briefly go over a few of the latest TV Shows/Movies I got to partake in:)  

**TV Shows/Movies, etc!**

I used to be a fan of binge watching shows, as far back as even the earliest days of the internet!  But, back then, it was much more difficult to be able to do this!  I would typically trade with collectors.  I would have some rare stuff recorded from VHS, and vice versa!  I amassed quite a few things this way, that simply were simply not easily foreseen as any official future Releases!  Not to mention, many times, when things do go through official channels...the licensed music "be gone"!  I was actually surprised to find Metallica in episodes of Supernatural on Netflix!  Whereas, all the original good music that aired in the Knight Rider show, were pretty much removed!  Hell, even Captain N: Game Master had many songs edited out of the DVD Releases!  And, ironically, none of the songs in the show were even originals.  They were all cover tunes.

In any case, I was a massive fan of stuff like Tales from the Darkside, Monsters, Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, Get a Life, Sledge Hammer, Automan, Manimal, Mr. Merlin, Wizard, Misfits of Science, the Powers of Matthew Star, Voyagers.  I tended to like a lot of shows that simply fell off the face of the earth in time!  But, I was thoroughly pleased to find that some of these had huge cult followings in other countries, such as Sweden and Norway, and so on!  What many of us took for granted, became hugely popular shows elsewhere!  What cult classic status shows are you a fan of?:)

As far as current movies and TV, I have found the 9th season of Dexter to be quite fun!  2 more episodes to go!  And, Cobra Kai is on season 4.  I truly hope they go a few more seasons on the show.  They have already stated they will keep trying to go as far as they can.  I have always been a fan of the original films!  I even went to the theater to see the Hillary Swank one, heh.  She has really gone onto far better things, including winning academy awards for Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby!

I finally found out about Yellowstone, yet still have to watch it!  But, I decided to start with 1883 first, which is pretty fun so far.  Westerns are far less prominent, nowadays, than they were when I was a kid.  I couldn't wake up on a Sunday morning, back in the day, without my mom watching any of 4 different Western Shows!  I personally enjoyed Wild Wild West, which had some of the same writers and style as Land of the Giants and Lost in Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea!

In any case, be sure to let me know some of your recent fun TV Shows and Movies!

**Off to the Mod Races!**

This is quite a substantial Update, as I set out with the intent to try to pull off something that simply wasn't easily possible in the earlier Mini Classic Days.  But, here we are, with great success!  Bullet Points, here we come!  Enjoy the Update!:)

**Thank You!**

It is becoming trickier to be able thank the hundreds of people I communicate with before, during, after each and every Update!  So, just want you all to know, you kick some major ass with your continued support!  None of this would be possible without ANY of you!:)  By Request, I brought back some Cores that people sorely missed, when they were removed Last Update, such as SNES9x Bright, SNES9x 2005 Plus!  GBA Cores that were removed, still have no practical usage for us currently.  So, unless someone is able to pinpoint a viable reason to readd any of them, we should be good on the current ones, for now!

**Homebrew!**

Homebrew games have generally escaped my interest, much of the time!  But, I have become more fond of the amazing efforts and dedication and work that many have put forth into these ventures!  There are some more games added to the Mod Hub, handpicked by Requiem, who has also been an asset in helping test stuff for Releases!  His YouTube Channel is in the Hot Links above!  He recently did a top 50 NES homebrew, which is now one of my favorite go-to videos to find more games to check out and play!  And, if you are an anime fan, his One-Piece Bounty Video should prove to be a fun watch!

ROOMS, by Jonny Manjiro, is now in the Mod Hub.  You know how you go down a rabbit hole, so to speak...google one thing, click another link, then another.  Same holds true for YouTube.  After watching a few "homebrew" videos, including Requiem's, ROOMS showed up in my suggested to watch feed.  And, I instantly watched and felt it had potential for some true greatness.  He was quite modest about the game, once I communicated with him.  But, be sure to check it out!  You can leave comments and thoughts on his YouTube Video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6rXpCFG-Jg

After chatting with him, he provided me with an updated 1.2 version, with some of the following changes:

 - New character sprite designed by my friend Damien@Famiconmaniac (he does animation for a living
 - No longer graphical glitches when loading or reloading a room with lots of objects.
 - Music no longer stutters upon death or a room clear
 - Added more animation to ladder climbing
 - Adjusted colors of some objects to unify the cool color theme

Ideally, it would be fun to see some "reasonable" suggestions be made, that Jonny could utilize in future updates to the game.  I gave him a few already!  But, I will leave to more right now:)  1. Counter.  But, not a Death Counter, or such.  Try to ground the game in such a way, where the counter is like (once you've beaten the game) it says, "You've fallen and gotten back up 47 times! Congratulations Padawan."  And, maybe, each time you do "fall", use humorous anecdotal jabs, as inspiration.  Just flash them on the screen for a split second, long enough to read.  It shows "ROOMS" now.  But, imagine if it had several different messages that could pop up, like cultural references to movies or tv shows...IE: "Did they fail in taking down Bruce in Jaws Part 1?"  (BTW: Sharks in the Jaws series were named after real life lawyers!)

Some Homebrews that made the Mod Hub, this Release, include: Black Castle (User0x7f) and Die And Retry (KABCORP MGS) for GB; L'Abbaye Des Morts (Locomalito|Gryzor87) for MD; Alwa's Awakening: Demo (Elden Pixels), Blade Buster (High Level Challenge), Blob Quest (Tom Livak), Flea: Demo (Lowtek Games|Alastair Low), Ghoul Grind: Night of the Necromancer: Demo (Woog Worx), ROOMS (Jonny Manjiro) for NES; Cho Ren Sha 68K (Koichi "Famibe No Yosshin" Yoshida) for Sharp X68000; Flight of Pigarus (Kagesan) for SMS.  Thanks again, Requiem, for handpicking these masterpieces, that include Castlevania like Platformers, SHMUPS, and more!  You will all have to try them all out to see for yourself how fun they are!  And, you can also go to Requiem's YouTube Channel to see many of these in action, within his videos!  And, special thanks to the original developers who made all of these!  

**Game & Watch Simulator Update!**

In collaboration with Luca from MADrigal's Simulator's Website, which is linked to in the hotlinks above, I have put together a special set of "simulators" of 59 different handheld games that run with the Libretro Game & Watch Core.  Many of you have owned or STILL own these!  I, myself, owned quite a few!  And, they are just as fun now as they were then!  I did a Video Tutorial on the overall setup of these for MD/SNES/NES Classics.  PSC Users, simply grab the PC versions, and run directly after installing AutoBleem and the Xtreme Injector!  Thanks Luca Antignano and Andre Leiradella! 

**Higher Quality Sound!**

For MD/SNES/NES/PSC, you will find, with this Release...sound quality is way better than in any previous Release!  This is especially true if you go the Xtreme SC route with 184 or 198!  And, 185 on PSC!  Typically, attempting to strive for higher sound quality would cause tremendous strain on RetroArch/Cores/Memory.  So, we truly never got to enjoy some of these games as they were originally intended to sound on the Mini Classics!  No problem on the real hardware/PCs, etc.  Just no cigar for the Minis!  

In any case, try out Akumajo Densetsu AKA Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse on the updated Fceumm Xtreme, and your mind will be blown, as far as the sound differential of now versus earlier releases!  Make sure it is the Japan version you try, as it has a special sound chip!  And, you can then proceed to check out sound quality on many other Cores, including N64, PS1, SNES, MD, and so on!  It is a beautiful thing, indeed!  And, MAME 2003 Xtreme now supports the Higher Quality "Flac" Samples!  If you scroll down in the RetroArch ReadMes, while viewed in Hakchi, you can see how to run "samples" on your USB!  For PSC Users, this is already a given:)  Also, for NES, check out Moryou Senki Madara, Esper Dream 2: A New Battle, and Lagrange Point...all unequivocally astounding sounding games!

**PicoDrive 32X Better!**

32X games are much better now!  And, quite a few other optimizations went into updated PicoDrive.  Thanks to all devs involved!  

**Amped Flycast/LudicrousN64/Opera/PCSX HD!**

Personal thanks walknight, for his amazing collaboration with Flycast/Opera Fix Ups:)

Note: on PSC, with Updated Flycast Xtreme and Mupen Xtreme, if you find you have no controller selected, simply go into RetroArch Settings, Controls, "choose" controller, save it as a mapper core/game/content directory override.  And, if it doesn't immediately take, simply restart the Core/Game!  You can also utilize the N64 Xtreme Mappers in the Add-Ons! Section, that myself, BlackSunshine, and MadFranko008 worked on, so you can run "nearly" all N64 Games with just an SNES equivalent controller (D-Pad, hell yeah!)

Flycast gets a nifty update for all of the Minis.  On MD/SNES/NES, compatibility is much higher.  Many Homebrew/Fan Made Games, etc, now work, including Gunlord (all other NG:Dev.Team games, too!), Intrepid Izzy (MetroidVania style!)  On PSC, things are even more Amped!  Dolphin Blue and other games that previously crashed, no longer do!  You can "fully" play Dolphin Blue from beginning to end!  PCSX HD Xtreme is now even better, with support for "many more" games in HD!  Try out Die Hard Trilogy!  3DO Games are "actually" reasonably playable now, depending on the game, with the Updated Opera Xtreme Core.  You can "reverse overclock", if need be, via Core Option, to boost your performance and speed!  Note, this may cause instabilities, which can lead to games freezing or crashing!  But, try out Demolition Man and Wolfenstein!  You can reverse overclock Wolfenstein til around 35-40 or so, and it runs super nice:)  

Many other Cores have this newfound benefit, including MAME 2003 Xtreme, which has a 14-28 percent increased performance/speed boost over the last Update!  And, LudicrousN64 Xtreme is now Amped to a much higher degree!

Speaking of walknight.  He did what many do, were more modest about things, as far as what they believed they were helping out with.  ANY efforts, that benefit us Mini Classic Users, or other platforms, makes a tremendous difference, no matter how small or big!  In his case, what was initially, "I don't think I have helped much", led to many days and weeks of chatting, pinpointing various bugs, sorting them out, testing them.  And, now, here we are, better Opera, Flycast, LudicrousN64 Xtreme, and more!  So, thanks again, walknight!  It was an honor and privilege to brainstorm ideas and concepts with you.  And, after your thoughts about new dynarec having a bug, my further analysis of the coding was able to lead to a bit of exploiting for us on the Minis, to stop N64 Games from Crashing on LudicrousN64Xtreme!

Also, special thanks to DemiGodX and Magnus RC on the PSC front, who have also been awesome with feedback, testing, critical information, that helps me in regard to some paths I take with these Cores!  They also both have YouTube Channels well worth checking out!  Just search for their names, exactly as named above, and you will quickly find their channels.

**No More Crashing N64 Games with LudicrousN64 Xtreme!**

In the past, it was mandatory to have Xtreme Virtual Ram installed, in order to be able to have a shot at playing games like Paper Mario, Killer Instinct, Super Smash Bros., and so on!  But, now, whether or not you have Virtual Ram installed...MOST N64 Games will no longer crash!  I was able to do a from scratch set-up, install Killer Instinct, StarFox 64, and other crash prone games...And, I successfully beat them from beginning to end, without a single crash!  If you have a USB Drive, however, Virtual Ram still very much has its merits, including the help with loading larger "sound samples" for MAME 2003 Xtreme and Doom Sigil!  And, it can push you a little further in many Dreamcast Games!  Speaking of Virtual Ram!...

**Xtreme Virtual Ram updated to 768 MB! (Mini MD/SNES/NES!)**

Personal thanks to MadFranko008 for his extensive testing, which helped hone in on this perfect number, as far as most optimal Virtual Ram limits!  And, also thanks for him helping test LudicrousN64 Xtreme Amped Update, and helping resolve a memory/save bug!

**What Other Fun Stuff!?**

Well, Vice X64 Xtreme has Ram Memory Expansion, making it possible to now run the Commodore 64 Port of Sonic the Hedgehog, which is quite fun as hell!  Thanks sonninnos for the incredible work with Commodore Code!  Me, being into oldschool stuff, I am a fan of Intellivision.  I remember going over to a friend's house, and they had one.  It was literally my one and only time I ever got to see the system in action!  Intellivoice was an awesome module you could get, that allowed "real speech" to play with several games.  Many who were on consoles, wouldn't really notice "speech" of this kind, til later on...with games, such as Adventures of Bayou Billy on NES, or even Joe Montana Sports Talk Football on MD!  But, here it was, years previous to these games, on a rival to Atari 2600!  Be sure to check out the games that have Intellivoice Support, including Space Spartans, Bomb Squad, B-17 Bomber, Tron: Solar Sailer, Intellivision World Series Baseball, and a few other "protos".  Thanks nanochess for the Intellivoice Support!  

**Speaking of Crashing!?  How about a Compatibility Boost?**

I may not always be able to respond to all messages or comments or feedback I get.  But, I assure you, I do make sure to read all of it!  And, I try to get back to everyone, when I am able to.  I really am not a fan of trying to do it on my phone, when I can type soooo much faster on a computer keyboard!  Some feedback consists of X game having Y behavior, or simply not working.  Anytime someone brings up a game that has an issue, I try to look into things...to better understand if there is a solution.  Sometimes, I utilize creative workarounds and/or exploits to pull these off.  

There are several PS1 Games that had terrible problems running, such as the NBA Live Games, Parasite Eve, Dragon Valor, Star Wars Jedi Power Battles, Looney Tunes: Sheep Raider, and so on.  These are just some of the ones that I have had to look into.  And, luckily, with collaboration and communication, we were able to get these resolved with the PCSX, etc Cores.  BUT, there are deeper, more inherent issues when it comes to the Mini Classics, as well as some other lower spec platforms.  They need to use Dynamic Recompiler, with is essentially "recalculating data" on the fly!  This can be a double edged sword, as when it recalculates, depending on whichever game...it can slow things down to a standstill, freeze, crawl, or even crash!  If you were to turn Dynamic Recompiler off, however, games would generally be far too slow to work.  But, they would usually no longer crash or have the other issues they did while Dynarec was enabled!

So, I decided to become very creative with this.  What if I worked things out, where we could boot performance and speed, and NOT use Dynamic Recompiler!?  Yes, a silly and almost impossible challenge, at first thought!  BUT, I was able to make it work, which helped more games function, such as WWE In Your House, Expendable, Johnny Bazookatone, Night Raid, and several more!  All of these aforementioned games have hideous graphics glitches while Dynamic Recompiler is on, or simply crash!  So, I did special builds for PCSX HD and Mednafen PSX, wherein Dynamic Recompiler takes a backseat, so the recalculations aren't as big a problem.  I affected this in the previous Release with a few other Cores.  And, it worked out, such as with the PC-98!  This leads into:

**Mod Formulas**

Now then, this "methodology" which I enacted will work with what I am now deeming "mod formulas".  These will be loosely discussed in these Notes.  But, I will do video tutorials, soon, showing how they work!  With these formulas, which befit certain criteria, you will have boundless opportunities to do things never thought possible on the Mini Classics, as well as other low spec platforms, before...including finally running The above 4 games!  Now only can you run Johnny Bazookatone with the 2 PS1 Cores I outlined above.  But, you can even now run the 3DO version!  Again, I will better clarify how these formulas work, in on hands video tutorials!  These Tutorials will show you all how to run games, such as Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, "Cel Shaded" Game Shader, Jet Force Gemini, and countless other...previously thought to be "not possible" games!  Now that I have finally adapted to a better video capture/microphone system, tutorials will be more resounding in their lasting effect in helping you all personally pull these feats of mod awesomeness off!

**Yes, Math does matter!**

You may have all heard the, "You will never need Math in real life", bit from school:)  But, many of the things I exploit directly cater to math factoring.  I set a base point, and using math, I am quickly able to determine the optimal low and high points to these.  This helps some games/cores run bigger, badder, better, faster, as well as helps with compatibility.  BUT, I tend to go against the grain, which also makes some of these additions quite unstable!  It would be like the equivalent of cooking a hot dog with a blow torch, or even a flame thrower, rather than just nuking it in the microwave!  But, it gets results for us on the Minis!  And, that is what counts!  And, with all of you giving tremendous support over the last 6 years of the Mini Classics, thus far...you have directly helped make this Scene what it is!  Moving forward, here is what to expect!

**Future of the Mini Classics!?**

"Dating" Cores, etc, is becoming more of an obsolete thing, since several Cores, moving forward...will, unfortunately, be less capable of being updated for us.  A majority of the changes tend to be more favorable towards PC Platforms.  On the grand scheme of things, in a relationship sense, it isn't exactly easy to maintain Windows XP forever!  Sometimes, in order to progress to future points, some Cores simply have to take a road towards newer, more stable graphics libraries!  BUT, that being said, myself and others will still work with the Cores that can be Updated!  MAME 2003 Plus/Xtreme, Genesis Plus GX, gpSP, FCEUmm, and many others will STILL get nice updates.  But, select others, simply will be less able to.  I will notate these with Future Releases!  

In order to even get N64 Cores Updated for this Release, I had to painstakingly study and analyze thousands of lines of code, to best decide what would or would NOT work for us, on our ends!  I feel I have at least succeeded in getting us deeper into fun territory N64 Wise, this time around, as N64 Games can finally be played without crashes!  BUT, there are still a few other issues and conflicts, inherent to our platforms, that are causal to "frame buffering" and "tlb exception" and "dynamic recompiler", and so on...issues!

People keep asking about future AutoBleem, RetroBoot, Hakchi, etc Updates.  Or, support for other Mini Classics.  Newer RetroArch for PSC (Wayland Issues, and a few other bugs!). The only thing I can say regarding this is "surprises may happen at anytime".  But, we are also at a point where "limitations" of the Mini Classics can only take us so far!  So, take that as you will!  

**Next Release?!**

Brutal Doom will be one of the things taken into account, Next Update.  I will do more with Amiga, check into better Famicom Disk Switching for those on Famicom Minis, that have "tethered" controllers, and do not use USB-HOST!  I will follow-up with Feedback, Comments, etc, from all of you, and see what I can get, in that respect, too!

**Final Notes!**

Two of my jobs relocated due to aftershock effects from Covid on the Economy.  What used to be 14 minute drive for me between both, and home, in addition to my IT Tech work, now becomes an hour one way, a half hour the other.  So, with that being said, I will likely only do Updating of Release Stuff 1-3 times per week, with the additional many hours of drive time.  I will keep up on communication from all of you, of course.  And, whatever falls into place, as far as what I feel or you all want, I will try to work in!  For now, however, enjoy this Update!

**Sincerely, KM:)**

P.S.:  I will do some more Video Tutorials, showcases, etc, on how to pull off some of the stuff that you may still have questions about, such as running WWE In Your House, Johnny Bazookatone, MAME stuff, etc!  Just feel free to ask, and I will prioritize those demonstrations/tutorials!

**To see prior Release change logs for 2017-2021, go into Xtras/Releases!**
